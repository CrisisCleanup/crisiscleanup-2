  home_main_4: "Crisis Cleanup helped dozens of relief agencies in the Dallas area assist survivors."
  home_main_5: "Hurricane Sandy"
  home_main_6: "Our first major incident, more than 120 organizations and 30,000 volunteers used Crisis Cleanup to assist more than 5,000 families."
  home_main_7: "TX / OK Floods"
  home_main_8: "The Texas-Oklahoma floods devastated Wimberly, TX and other small towns. Crisis Cleanup was the coordination system of record for community relief efforts."
  home_main_9: "Boston Snowstorm"
  home_main_10: "The Boston snowstorm of 2015 paralyzed the city. When volunteers by the hundreds helped their neighbors, Crisis Cleanup helped them coordinate their efforts."
  home_main_11: "Black Forest Fires"
  home_main_12: "Crisis Cleanup was used extensively during the Colorado Black Forest Fires."
  home_main_13: "S. NJ Dericho Storms"
  home_main_14: "More than 700 volunteers helped several hundred elderly residents remove downed trees in Southern New Jersey. Crisis Cleanup drastically improved efficiency and coordination."
  home_main_15: "Crisis Cleanup is a free, award-winning, ready-to-use, open source application that connects disaster recovery organizations with the people who need help."
  home_main_16: "How do you direct 30,000 volunteers from 100 organizations to 5,000 locations across a 500-mile arc in 8 weeks?"
  home_main_17: "You don't. You let them organize themselves."
  home_main_18: "Crisis Cleanup empowers relief organizations to instantly coordinate response efforts in real time, redirecting thousands of volunteers from to waiting lines to survivors' basements."
  home_main_19: "Crisis Cleanup was developed by and for field volunteers, team leaders, canvassers, and the people who work one-on-one with survivors whose homes have been affected by flood, tornadoes, earthquakes, wind, fire, or other disaster. Crisis Cleanup can respond to a new disaster the same day, permitting relief organizations to instantly coordinate efforts."
  home_main_20: "Crisis Cleanup implements a \"Craigslist\" philosophy to recovery efforts– organizations that are aware of work orders enter them into the system, and organizations with capacity to help can claim and perform the work. The system is not public, but it is open and transparent among participating organizations. No centralized organization is \"in charge.\" This non-threatening approach minimizes duplication and maximizes communication, coordination, and efficiency."
  home_main_21: "While entering a client into Crisis Cleanup does not guarantee that he or she will be served, it guarantees visibility and maximizes the chances for assistance, while helping relief organizations prioritize their limited resources."
  home_main_22: "Organizations Using Crisis Cleanup"

  about_3: "Mission: To help voluntary relief organizations help more people by enabling collaborative disaster recovery."
  about_4: "Crisis Cleanup helps relief organizations help more people."
  about_5: "Crisis Cleanup is a collaborative disaster work order management platform that improves coordination, reduces duplication of efforts, improves efficiency and improves volunteers' experience. Crisis Cleaning It works best when a large number of volunteer organizations with many volunteers work together to large numbers of people in a large area, all at the same time. "
  about_9: "Crisis Cleanup helps with the \"4Cs\" of disaster recovery:"
  about_10: "Communication, Coordination, Collaboration, and Cooperation,"
  about_11: " as well as Competition. Crisis Cleanup does "
  about_12: "not"
  about_13: "create the \"4Rs\" of disaster recovery: Relationships, Resources, Roles, and Responsibilities. It cannot fix relationships, create resources, or dictate who does what."
  about_6: "Crisis Cleanup embraces and supports the interests of disaster survivors by providing transparent, collaborative, and privacy-enhancing open source technology to assist those who directly interact with and help survivors."
  about_7: "Crisis Cleanup is an open source project and operates through the fiduciary agent Crisis Cleanup, LLC based out of New Jersey. We are currently looking for a non-profit fiscal agent. Other organizations sponsor implementations of Crisis Cleanup in Australia, India, the Philippines, and elsewhere."
  about_8: "Foundational Philosophies:"
  about_14: "Crisis Cleanup is for collaborative work order management; not volunteer, donations or case management. To protect clients, "
  about_15: "Crisis Cleanup is about property, not people."
  about_16: "The right way to do things is however it gets done, locally."
  about_17: "Technology should enhance, not replace, inter-organization relationships."
  about_18: "There is no pyramid, and you're not on top. Voluntary organizations are co-equal, sovereign and interdependent; no single organization is in charge."
  about_19: "Collaboration and communication should be not only convenient, but required."
  about_20: "There is no such thing as the \"One App to Rule them All.\" The system should not try to do things it was not intended to do."
  about_21: "The system tracks property, not people. Consequently, strict personal information minimization policies are in place."
  about_22: "Crisis Cleanup's real innovation is the ability to coordinate tens of thousands of volunteers from hundreds of organizations to thousands of sites after a disaster in a non-hierarchical collaborative environment"
  about_23: ". Crisis Cleanup proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only convenient, but required."

  surivor_19: "Never give up hope"
  surivor_20: "Remember that you are a normal person reacting to an abnormal event. Seek the counsel and advice of trusted friends, family, counselors, case managers, even attorneys who can guide you through the baffling maze of spiritual, emotional, physical, and legal pitfalls that await.

  vol_41: "But I just want to help! Can't I just join an organization through Crisis Cleanup?"
  vol_42: "Unfortunately not. Please apply directly to the organization of your choice. Don't try to affiliate through Crisis Cleanup. You need to be vetted and trained by the organization first. Applying here will only distract field volunteers from their primary mission of helping survivors."
  vol_43: "What should I do if I'm an Unaffiliated Volunteer?"
  vol_44: "Volunteering as an SUV is hard. Our advice is to be"
  vol_45: "be patient, be persistent, and never give up hope."

  training_3: "Mandatory Training Video"
  training_4: "Test Your Crisis Cleanup Knowledge!"
  training_5: "Take this quick poll to see how much you understand about Crisis Cleanup."
  training_6: "You can use Crisis Cleanup to do donations management, case management, logistics, etc."
  training_7: "Crisis Cleanup is a collaborative work order management system; it is not \"The One App to Rule them All.\" Crisis Cleanup is designed to coordinate large numbers of volunteers to large numbers of locations to perform property cleanup and remediation work. Donations management, case management, volunteer management, assets management, logistics, etc. are each a vital part of disaster recovery, but outside the scope of Crisis Cleanup."
  training_8: "How much does Crisis Cleanup cost?"
  training_9: "Crisis Cleanup is currently free to disaster recovery organizations."
  training_10: "Crisis Cleanup should be used primarily by field workers."
  training_11: "Field work powers the Crisis Cleanup database. Crisis Cleanup was designed to optimize efforts of team leaders and field workers. Although the system is a useful coordination and management tool, the life blood of Crisis Cleanup is the field worker. Crisis Cleanup assists workers to plan, prioritize, and execute property remediation activities. As a result, if the system is not actively used in the field, it is also useless as a coordination and management tool."
  training_12: "Your organization is responsible for keeping client information confidential."
  training_13: "Although Crisis Cleanup should have no confidential personal information, it contains some contact information. Please keep all client information confidential."
  training_14: "When must you claim a work order?"
  training_16: "Crisis Cleanup utilizes a \"Craigslist\" philosophy to disaster recovery. Organizations that know of a need enter the information, and organizations with capacity claim the work orders at their convenience. We certainly encourage coordination with other voluntary organizations, state, and county government officials, but Crisis Cleanup will never force you to perform work. You're in charge. See"
  training_17: "Intro Video"
  training_18: "Always store as much sensitive personal information in Crisis Clean up as possible."
  training_19: "False! Under no circumstance should you store sensitive personal information in Crisis Cleanup. Only store information directly relevant to organizing workers or prioritizing work orders. NEVER store medical information, social security numbers, rent information, FEMA numbers, etc. See "
  training_20: "Client Data Collection Policy"
  training_21: " What kind of organizations may participate?"
  training_22: "Only organizations approved by the state government."
  training_23: "Only members of a state, national, or county VOAD."
  training_24: "Unaffiliated individuals and volunteers."
  training_25: "Any reputable non-profit recovery organization that interacts directly with survivors in cleanup efforts."
  training_26: "Crisis Cleanup has a bias for inclusion, but only reputable organizations that interact directly with survivors in cleanup efforts may participate. Individual volunteers may not access Crisis Cleanup. See"
  training_27: "Requirements for Participation"
  training_28: "You are responsible for updating completed or partially completed work orders."
  training_29: "Crisis Cleanup utilizes a decentralized \"Craigslist\" approach to disaster recovery. No single centralized organization is in charge, so we expect you to clean up after yourself. Please be sure to update the status to \"Closed\" when the work order is completed. Managing the work load will be much easier if you permit all of your team leaders to update Crisis Cleanup themselves."
  training_30: "Who is in charge of Crisis Cleanup?"
  training_31: "The state, county, or local government."
  training_32: "National or State VOADs."
  training_33: "This guy"
  training_34: "Hint: Wrong answer"
  training_35: "Crisis Cleanup works a lot like Craigslist--Craig keeps the servers running, but the community is in charge of powering the system. Although you may report to county and state governments and other organizations in real life, no single organization is in charge of Crisis Cleanup. Everybody works together toward a common goal. Crisis Cleanup operates on the principle of Collaborative Accountability: When interdependent, co-equal partners pressure and assist one another to accomplish a goal. See"
  training_36: "Is Crisis Cleanup a Good Fit?"
  training_37: "You may unclaim a work order if you do not have the resources to perform the work."

  training_41: "Work Order/ Case Claiming Policy"
  training_42: "Mandatory Training Video"
  training_43: "All participating organizations can see what all of the other organizations are doing."
  training_44: "Crisis Cleanup makes coordination not only required, but easy. Every participating organization can see what the others are doing, significantly improving coordination and communication."
  training_45: "Who may enter work orders?"
  training_46: "Any member of the public."
  training_47: "Any participating organization, including your own."
  training_48: "Only 2-1-1 or other authorized call-in centers."
  training_49: "Only your state VOAD or system administrator."
  training_50: "To preserve confidentiality, only reputable organizations that interact directly with survivors in cleanup efforts may participate in Crisis Cleanup. Any participating organization may perform assessments and enter work orders into the system. While Crisis Cleanup may accept preliminary damage assessment information from the public sometime in the future, it does not currently."

Seeief organization doesn't do a work order they've claimed?"
  training_52: " Fill out a trouble ticket."
  training_53: "Nothing."
  training_54: "Break their kneecaps."
  training_55: "Contact that organization to see how you can help, and find out what's going on."
  training_56: "In every disaster some organizations claim work orders they can't fulfill, or fail to complete necessary paperwork. Technology won't solve that problem, but Crisis Cleanup does allow you to see the problem for the first time. And because you can see the problem, you can fix the problem by leveraging relationships and supporting fellow relief agencies."
  training_57: "It is possible to download a copy of all work orders."
  training_58: "You can always"
  training_59: "download a CSV"
  training_60: "or Excel file with all work orders, for your records and to run reports."
  training_61: "Each user is responsible to keep his/her own passwords secure."
  training_62: "Please visit the"
